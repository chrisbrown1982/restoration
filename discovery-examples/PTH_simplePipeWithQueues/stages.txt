- original.c -- pthread version
- pth.1.cpp -- pthread removal
  + We are back to simple pthread_create conversion here as pthread_join takes NULL
    * Note that we should probably remove for loops that only have pthread_joins in them
  + This is broken because the first stage adds more elements to the buffer than it has room for.
- pth.2.cpp -- code repair begins
  + Lifted the pipeline stages into their own function, ready for unfolding.
- pth.3.cpp
